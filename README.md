Branching strategy:

When you work on your own code. Make sure you are on 'master' branch.

You can check by typing "git branch"

Then, get the latest code by running "git pull"

When you decide to work on something, please create your own branch by typing "git checkout -b <yourname>_chapter3_question3"

Then, you can bring your change by using "git add ."

git commit -m "commit something onto your own branch"

git push #you will get hint about running "push" command

Then, create pull request in github UI. I will review the code.

Let me know if you have questions
